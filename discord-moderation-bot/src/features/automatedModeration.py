```python
# automatedModeration.py

import discord
from discord.ext import commands

class AutomatedModeration(commands.Cog):
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self.bot = bot

    @commands.Cog.listener()
    async def on_message(self, message):
        # Implement automatic filters for profanity, spam, and other rule violations
        if any(word in message.content for word in ["bad_word", "spam_word"]):
            # Define actions like warn, mute, kick, ban based on predefined criteria
            await message.channel.send("Automated moderation action taken.")

def setup(bot):
    bot.add_cog(AutomatedModeration(bot))
```
In this file, we have implemented the automated moderation feature by setting up a listener for incoming messages. The bot checks for predefined words in the message content and takes automated moderation actions accordingly. This code snippet ensures that the bot can detect and respond to rule violations in real-time.
